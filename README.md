React Router Tutorial
=====================

Quick lessons for getting up-to-speed with React Router.

See [Lesson 1 - Setting Up](/lessons/01-setting-up/) to get started.

Each lesson is a fully runnable app with all code from the previous lesson, so you can `cd lessons/<lesson-folder>`, npm install,
and then run the appropriate NPM scripts for each lesson from within the lesson folder.

Missing stuff that will come eventually, hopefully ... maybe.
